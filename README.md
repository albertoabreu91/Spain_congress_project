## Project Description
The Catalonia Congress voting data 2016 project is trying to analyze the influence of Catalonian political parties by age range. The main obejctive is to gather insights regarding the influence of each party in the young voters. 

We choose this project due to the great influence that the independence spirit has in young voters to elect one party over others. 

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions

Our main hypothesis that we want to prove wrong is:

The young voter from age 20 to 34 is not influence by the direction of one catalonian party, saying right, center or left, as long as they are separatist.

Questions to ask:

1- What catalonian party has more influence per region. 

2- Which catalonian municipe or town has more democratic spitir.
